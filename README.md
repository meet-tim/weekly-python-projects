# Weekly Python Projects

Welcome to the Weekly Python Projects repository! This is where I share my Python projects that I complete each week. In this repository, you'll find a collection of diverse Python projects, ranging from simple scripts to more complex applications, showcasing my progress and growth as a Python developer.

##History
I started this challenge some time ago until i lost my pc. Finally retrieved everything and i think i should share it out to other developers and also to be able to easily retrieve in case of an accident.
## Motivation

The motivation behind this repository is to document my journey of learning and exploring Python by challenging myself to complete a new project every week. By undertaking these projects, I aim to:

- Apply the concepts and techniques I have learned in Python.
- Enhance my problem-solving skills.
- Expand my knowledge of Python libraries, frameworks, and tools.
- Build a portfolio of Python projects that demonstrate my abilities to potential employers or collaborators.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, with each directory representing a specific week. Inside each week's directory, you will find the project files and any additional resources associated with that project. The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
.
├── Projectname
│   ├── file.py
│   ├── file.py
│   ├── ...
│   └── README.md
├── Projectname
│   ├── file.py
│   ├── file.py
│   ├── ...
│   └── README.md
```

## Project Documentation

Each week's project has its own dedicated `README.md` file that provides detailed information about the project. The `README.md` file includes:

- Project description and goals.
- Required dependencies or libraries.
- Instructions on how to set up and run the project.
- Examples and usage instructions.
- Any additional notes or considerations.

Feel free to explore the projects that interest you, read their documentation, and use them as a reference or source of inspiration for your own projects.
